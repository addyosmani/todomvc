# Scalejs TodoMVC Example

Develop scalable single-page JavaScript applications in Visual Studio using scalejs framework. The extension adds project and item templates to simplify developing scalejs applications, modules, and extensions. 

Scalejs framework is targeted towards a .Net developer who has experience with Silverlight or WPF and is looking for ways to apply same principles and patterns (e.g. MVVM, bindings, modularization, templated controls, reactive programming, animated transitions, navigation, etc.) to JavaScript client side development. 

It's inspired by Nicholas Zakas "Scalable JavaScript Application Architecture" talk. The framework leverages best libraries such as KnockoutJS, LinqJS, RxJS, requirejs, scion, LESS, etc., and relies on what's considered as "good parts" of JavaScript language.

Fully integrated with Visual Studio (e.g. dependency management via NuGet, Intellisense support, MSBuild integration, etc.)
