# Dart â€¢ [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com)

A TodoMVC sample built with Dart. It does not use a MVC framework - it's a Vanilla Dart sample.

Dart firstly targets the development of modern and large scale browser-side web apps. It's an object oriented language with a C-style syntax.

## Run

Dart has two run modes : it can be compiled to JS, and will later run in native VM in compliant browsers.

For now, you can run native Dart with [Chromium](http://www.dartlang.org/dartium/) which is provided with [Dart SDK](http://dartlang.org).

For testing purpose, dart/app.dart will run on any browser thanks to sdk/dart.js. First run will take time to process dart files.
