# SimpleJS TodoMVC Example

This implementation of TodoMVC only uses JavaScript and does not have external dependencies. It is implemented in the simplest way possible and can be useful for anyone who wants to establish their JavaScript skills before learning frameworks. For this reason, it does not use any of the MVC concepts such as models, views, controls or routers.

For templating, it uses own format and function. Look for the simpleTemplateEngine in app.js
