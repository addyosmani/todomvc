=========================================================================================

DUEL is a duel-sided template engine. Views written as markup get precompiled into both
JavaScript (client-side templates) and Java (server-side templates).

The client-side templates are executed as functions directly from JavaScript. The result
can be rendered as text or as DOM objects. This example generates DOM objects for views.

This particular example does not use the server-side templates, but they have also been
generated into the duel/build/java directory.
