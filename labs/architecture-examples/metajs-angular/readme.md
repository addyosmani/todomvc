# AngularJS + MetaJS TodoMVC Example

> HTML is great for declaring static documents, but it falters when we try to use it for declaring dynamic views in web-applications. AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.

> MetaJS is Lisp compiled to Javascript. Final code runs in browser or on NodeJs plaform without runtime dependencies. Lisp syntax allows to write less code to express same idea. It's not a joke that MetaJS compiler can guess your thoughts and generate missed parts of code.

This MetaJS implementation is based on [architecture-examples/angularjs](architecture-examples/angularjs). To see the difference between MetaJS and Javascript approaches you can compare code of main controller on [Javascript](architecture-examples/angularjs/js/controllers/todoCtrl.js) and [MetaJS](labs/architecture-examples/metajs-angular/mjs/controllers/todo_ctrl.mjs).
