## A Pattern, not a framework

SOOJS is a pattern that uses the strengths of JavaScript to create clearly understandable code. Frameworks are awesome, but sometimes we just need to write cleaner code. 

This implementation of TodoMVC uses SOOJS to clearly divide a view layer and abstract its complexities away from the controllers, model and connectors of the application. Following a very simple pattern allows JavaScript to be infinitely more maintainable and understandable.
