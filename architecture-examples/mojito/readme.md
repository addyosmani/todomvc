## TodoMVC - Mojito version

This is implementation of TodoMVC for Yahoo! Mojito - the unified JavaScript MVC framework. A Mojito application comprises of mojits - Mojito Widgets, where a mojit is a complete, redistributable module.

The folder structure is governed by Mojito framework:
- `src`: The main application folder. The folder `src/autoload` contains the application-wide library while `src/mojits/TodoMojit` contains the main mojit
- Other files: Mojito command line interface (CLI) has a command to create the html5app out of the source. The remaining files in this folder contains the output of the command, from the output folder `src/artifacts/html5app`
