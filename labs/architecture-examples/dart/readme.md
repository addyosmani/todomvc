# Dart â€¢ [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com)

A TodoMVC sample built with Dart. It does not use a MVC framework - it's a Vanilla Dart sample.

Dart firstly targets the development of modern and large scale browser-side web apps. It's an object oriented language with a C-style syntax.

## Run

Dart has two run modes : it can be compiled to JS, and will later run in native VM in compliant browsers.

You can for the moment :
- use a dedicated [Chromium](http://www.dartlang.org/dartium/) provided with [Dart SDK](http://dartlang.org) to run .dart files.
- run the JS compiled version (see [dart2js](http://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart2js/)), which can be found in /compiled directory.
