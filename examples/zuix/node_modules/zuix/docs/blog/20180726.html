<p>Yesterday I wanted to complete the documentation of the animated <code>hamburger_icon</code> button used in my previous post.</p>
<p>[[ DEV.TO POST https://dev.to/genejams/mobile-app-layout-from-scratch--5ch9 ]]</p>
<p>As often happens, documenting things will help to improve them and this will require a few last-minute changes, that in this case were about adding extra options for choosing different burger animations and colors. The result is available <a href="https://genielabs.github.io/zkit/docs/components/hamburger_icon">here</a>.</p>
<p>But wait a minute… I've used this <em>hamburger_icon</em> button in all of the 3 example projects on <em>Glitch</em> and also over a couple of other projects on GitHub pages.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Does that mean I've to copy the new code all over the different projects that are using the <em>hamburger_icon</em> and publish all of them once again?</p>

<p>Luckily that's <strong>not the case</strong> since none of those projects were holding a copy of employed bits but rather a direct link to the original source of each.</p>
<h2 id="uniquebits">Unique bits</h2>
<p>This is also what we can see in the <code>HTML</code> code used to implement the header bar in the last example of my previous post:</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;header data-ui-include="//zuix-app-1.glitch.me/layout/header"&gt;&lt;/header&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><small>A "bit" from <strong>index.html</strong> hosted on <strong>zuix-app-3</strong>.glitch.me</small></p>
<p>The <code>data-ui-include="//zuix-app-1.glitch.me/layout/header"</code> means that the <code>layout/header</code> is fetched directly from the server hosting the first example and that consists of these two files:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://<strong>zuix-app-1</strong>.glitch.me/layout/header.html</li>
<li>https://<strong>zuix-app-1</strong>.glitch.me/layout/header.css</li>
</ul>
<p>But then when we look at the <code>header.html</code> we see</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div class="logo"&gt;
    &lt;a href="/"&gt;app-logo&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-ui-load="@lib/components/hamburger_icon"
     data-ui-options="options.menuButton"
     class="menu-button"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>data-ui-load="@lib/components/hamburger_icon"</code> means that, in turn, the header will load the <code>components/hamburger_icon</code> from <code>@lib</code> (which is a shortcut to the <a href="https://genielabs.github.io/zkit">zKit</a> components collection server).</p>
<p>So <code>zuix-app-3</code> includes the <code>layout/header</code> from the <code>zuix-app-1</code> host and that also loads the <em>hamburger_icon</em> component from <code>genielabs.github.io/zkit</code>.</p>
<p>This means that if the <code>layout/header</code> is modified on the host <code>zuix-app-1</code> it will be automatically updated both on <code>zuix-app-2</code> and <code>zuix-app-3</code>, but also means that whenever the <code>components/hamburger_icon</code> is updated on <em>genielabs.github.io/zkit</em>, it will be seamlessly and instantly updated on all examples hosted on <em>Glitch</em>!</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/glmRyiSI3v5E4/giphy.gif" alt="What?!@#?" /></p>
<p>So using an unique reference to components has obvious advantages both for productivity and creativity, either when they're hosted on the same server or over a bunch of different ones.</p>
<h2 id="lovelybut">Lovely, but…</h2>
<p>In order to make this work without issues we must guarantee 100% backward compatibility whenever a distributed component is updated. If this is not possible, then a new path must be assigned to the updated component.</p>
<p>Also we must consider that downloading resources from multiple hosts of uncertain reliability can sometime compromise performance especially in presence of network issues. That's an old lesson already taught by the use of <em>CDNs</em>.</p>
<p>So when performance is a real concern about your application, a different strategy can be adopted and this consists of downloading all of the employed resources and packing them into a single local file.</p>
<p>But before you start to think I'm gonna talk about build systems, package managers, web packers and such, I want to reassure you that it is not.</p>
<p>Well, that would also be an option, but if we don't want yet to deal with those build tools, by just using <em>zUIx.js</em> we can generate the application bundle directly in the browser console.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/xTiTntReleqBnhBNwQ/giphy.gif" alt="Impossible" /></p>
<p>That's what I call <strong>in-browser bundling</strong> (or client-side bundling), but I'll be writing about this later.</p>
