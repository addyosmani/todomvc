Ext JS is a client-side, JavaScript framework with advanced MVC architecture, plugin-free charting,
and modern widgets that provide the industry's most powerful desktop application development platform.
Sencha Ext JS provides unparalleled cross-browser compatibility enabling you to develop incredible
apps for any browser.

Ext JS 4 brings a whole new way to build client applications, introducing the popular model-view-controller
pattern to Ext JS. By allowing the separation of data management, logic and interface elements, Ext JS 4
makes it easier for even large development teams to work independently without worrying about stepping on 
each other's toes. 

Ext JS is also complimented with a sister product, Sencha Touch, specifically written for mobile and
tablet environments allowing developers to create mobile apps to run in conjunction with desktop 
applications with very little (or no) modification to either set of code.

## Getting Started

Starting an Ext JS app is as simple as downloading the Ext JS SDK and pointing your browser to the
source directory to launch the sample applications, SDK documentation, guides and tutorials.

## Support

Ext JS and Sencha Touch are supported by a dedicated team of support staff as well as thousands of
other users. Though the use of our Sencha Forums you can find answers to most questions, get support
