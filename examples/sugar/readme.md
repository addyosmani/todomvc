## Repo name explanation

I create my repository and named `sugar` for some time before I knew there was a famous JavaScript library also named `sugar`. Named this repository as `sugar` has a special meaning for me, so I decide keep this name. This repository still in improvement and maintenance, it can handle most of the development needs.
