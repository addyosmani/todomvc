# React ES6 + Webpack TodoMVC Example

> React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces. Its core principles are declarative code, efficiency, and flexibility. Simply specify what your component looks like and React will keep it up-to-date when the underlying data changes.

## Differences from the React TodoMVC example

This example has updated to use the newest version of React at the time (16.4.1), released June 13, 2018. There have been plenty of changes compared to the version used in the other examples (0.13.3) that you can learn more about in the link listed above.

This project also makes use of modern ECMAScript 6 (ES6) syntax. Take a look at [its features](http://es6-features.org/) to get an idea of what's new with JavaScript.

With ES6 comes a different import/export syntax for modules that is not yet supported by all browsers. Because of this, changes to the project need to be watched by Webpack, which bundles all your modules with dependencies into static assets. Learn more about Webpack [here](https://webpack.js.org/).

## Running

The app is built with [JSX](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) and compiled at runtime for a lighter and more fun code reading experience. As stated in the link, JSX is not mandatory.

To run the app, run `npm install` and spin up an HTTP server (e.g. `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`) and visit http://localhost/.../myexample/.
