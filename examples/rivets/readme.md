# Rivets.js TodoMVC Example

> Rivets is a lightweight and powerful data binding + templating solution for building modern web applications.

> Rivets.js is completely agnostic about your model / controller layer and works well with existing libraries that employ an event-driven model such as Backbone.js and Stapes.js. It also ships with built-in support for plain JavaScript objects, so you can use Rivets.js right away without needing a separate model or observables library.

> From the event handlers to the template delimiters, the attribute prefixes to the preloading of data. It's all configurable and tunable at the application level as well as locally to individual views.
