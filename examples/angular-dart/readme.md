## Running

Dart compiles to JavaScript and thus runs across modern browsers. Dart also can
run in its own virtual machine.

Both Dart files and JS compilation result are provided in this sample,
therefore it actually works in any browser.

Run the `pub get` command first.
To edit and debug the code, you can use Webstorm, or any editor with the dart [plugin](https://www.dartlang.org/tools).
Then use the `pub serve` command to launch the development server.

## Compiling

```
pub build
```

The dart2js compilator can be found in the SDK.

The currently provided JS is minified (see `pubspec.yaml` file).
