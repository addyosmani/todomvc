# RenderJS TodoMVC Example

> RenderJS is great for developing complex applications from reusable gadgets.
Apps are asynchronous and give fine grained control as they are run as a 
single chain of promises with Vanilla JS in between. Together with jIO connecting 
and syncing with a storage of your choice, RenderJS/jIO allow to build robust
and progressive web apps quickly.
